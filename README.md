## Inventory System API

I developed this one as a part of practise. The aim is to develop an inventory management system,
and currently it has few features which are:

1. User registration as Owner
2. User verification (For simplification, it is now by auth code)
3. Create Store as Owner
4. Create SALES Stuff 
5. CRUD operation on product on your Store as Owner
6. Generate Invoice as Owner/Sales
7. Fetch Invoice List

more feature will be added soon ...
